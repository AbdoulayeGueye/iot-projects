## Update Jan. 31
It is time to fill a pull-request for your project proposal! **Deadlines for other delivrables to be expected soon**
* For those who have already created an `.md` file, create a pull-request as soon as possible! The reason is that we have to setup teams and repositories **where we will discuss the list of components and we will try to orient/re-orient your research by providing links or resources to begin with**.
* For those who did not create an `.md` file || do not have an idea || do not belong to a team, **do it as soon as possible** (the steps are below).

## Update Jan. 15
* We made a little update since the first lab. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr6IzOGoMsQ) is a video explaining how to make a contribution (a pull-request) to someone's repository;
* To get inspired, some readings about *Disney Reasearch* work [here](https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/designing-groundless-body-channel-communication-systems/);

## Step 1
<s>Clone</s> Fork this repository

## Step 2
After <s>cloning</s> forking this repository, you will create a folder `team-name` where you will write a `team-name.md` MARKDOWN file (`team-name` being the name of your team).
Your file must contain the following PRELIMINARY components:
* Members of your team (name, email, github profile);
* Name of your IoT product;
* A description of your IoT product (A problematic you are targeting, your solution, market you are targeting, etc.). **A paragraph of about 200 words should be fine**;
* A preliminary list of components that you think appropriate;
* [Optional] Any document that you find related to your project. These have to be put under a folder `team-name/resources/`;

This first step is very important and require, from you, a little work of research. Try to get inspired by what is done currently in the market (FabLabs, CES 2019, etc.).

## Step 3
You have until Sunday, January 2Oth (23h59) to fill a **pull-request** containing your proposition in this repository.

## Step 4
An approval (or enhancement) will be issued by us.

## Step 5
We will create, for you, a repository in `Institut Galil√©e - IoT` organization page.
We will follow your developments (commits, issues, discussions, etc.) and the more active you are, the more you get good appreciations for your final mark.
